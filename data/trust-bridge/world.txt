[Rooms]
# 1. The Entrance Hall

You stand in a grand entrance hall lit by shafts of sunlight filtering through high windows. Ancient murals on the walls depict teams of people working together to overcome great challenges. Three passages branch out from here: one to the east, one to the west, and one straight ahead.

A weathered journal lies on a pedestal in the center of the room.

# 2. The East Chamber

# 4. The Bridge Chamber

You emerge onto a vast platform overlooking a deep chasm. Before you stretches an ancient stone bridge, but it shimmers and flickers - clearly unstable. At the near end of the bridge stands a mechanical device with two slots. A sign reads: "Trust is the foundation. Unity is the destination. Together, they make the bridge solid."

On the far side of the bridge, you can see an exit bathed in golden light.

# 5. The Far Side

You've made it! Standing on the far side of the chasm, you look back at the now-solid bridge glowing with ancient magic. Through teamwork, communication, and trust, you solved a puzzle that cannot be solved alone.

The exit ahead leads to new adventures, but more importantly, you've learned that some challenges require us to combine our unique perspectives and discoveries.
